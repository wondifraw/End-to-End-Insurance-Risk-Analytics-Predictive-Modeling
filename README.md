## 📌 About the Project

The primary objective of this project is to analyze South African car insurance data to uncover risk segments and develop robust predictive models. This enables data-driven decision-making for premium optimization, customer segmentation, and targeted marketing.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of risk patterns, outliers, and temporal trends.
- **Data Version Control:** Reproducible data pipelines using DVC for tracking and managing datasets.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistical validation of business-critical hypotheses to drive actionable insights.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Development of machine learning models for claim severity prediction and premium optimization.
- **Model Interpretation:** Utilization of SHAP for transparent model interpretation and feature impact analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- DVC

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wondifraw/End-to-End-Insurance-Risk-Analytics-Predictive-Modeling.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd End-to-End-Insurance-Risk-Analytics-Predictive-Modeling
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Initialize DVC and pull the data:**
    ```bash
    dvc init
    dvc pull
    ```

## 💻 Usage

### Exploratory Data Analysis

To explore the data analysis and visualizations, run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/insurance_eda_stats_lossratio_analysis.ipynb
```

### Running Scripts

The project includes scripts for various tasks. For example, to run the data preprocessing script:
```bash
python src/preprocessor.py
```
*(Note: This is an example. You may need to adjust the command based on the actual script's functionality and arguments.)*
